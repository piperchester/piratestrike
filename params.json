{"name":"Pirate Strike!","tagline":"A simple battleship game from a Codecademy exercise.","body":"# Ahoy there, landlubber!  \r\n  \r\nPirateStrike is a simple battleship clone. Currently, it's supports Python 2.7 to Python 3.  \r\n\r\n### What's Next?\r\n  Pirate Strike allows the player to play against an AI pirate within the command line.\r\n\r\n### How do I play?\r\nCurrently the project just exists in one script. All you need to do is fork or download the script to play. Then run:  \r\n  \r\n    python piratestrike.py\r\n\r\nAnd that's it!\r\n\r\n### Future Plans\r\nI hope to bring Pirate Strike to the web. Maybe a GUI front-end? The possibilities are endless!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
