# Pirate Strike!   
  
Pirate Strike is a simple battleship clone. Currently, it's supports Python 2.7 to Python 3.  

### What's Next?
  Pirate Strike allows the player to play against an AI pirate within the command line.

### How do I play?
Currently the project just exists in one script. All you need to do is fork or download the script to play. Then run:  
  
    python piratestrike.py

And that's it!

### Future Plans
I hope to bring Pirate Strike to the web. Maybe a GUI front-end? The possibilities are endless!
